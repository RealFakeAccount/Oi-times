# Oi-times
*The story between programming and me starts here.*

These are part of codes I wrote in my high school, when I participated competitive programming.

I have wrote more than 600 questions in 2 years. and at least 80% of them, I believe, is equal to or above the leetcode medium difficulty. 

I also wrote lots of writeups to these problems in my old blogs.

I learnt tons of stuff in Computer Science during this impressive experience. Also, I got some real friends in the contest.

But most importantly, I found Computer is the thing I `truly` love.
